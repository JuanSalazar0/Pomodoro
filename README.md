This is my version of an UI in python to have a usable pomodoro tool
I used the following libraries:
  customtkinter (For the UI)
  threading (To be able to run the UI and the timer at the same time)
  pywhatkit (To be able to open YT videos from the UI)
  plyer (To sent notifications to windows)

I hope it is usefull to you, and if you have some feedback on it please let me know
